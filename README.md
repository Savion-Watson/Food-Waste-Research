# Food-Waste-Research-Data-Sources
An analysis of Food Waste data I completed for Undergraduate Research. 
I used data from the organization ReFED to better understand the causes of food waste in the residential sector of the United states.

Paper Abstract:
	Food waste is an important issue that causes families to go hungry and valuable resources to be squandered. Yet, one of the biggest contributors to food waste are often overlooked: American families. We hope to illustrate the causes of food waste by conducting a data-driven study. Our findings suggest that families buy more food than they eat, do not compost, and throw away leftovers. States that lack composting programs, and have communities that live far from supermarkets waste more food than others per capita. Families waste so much food that their spending even outpaces economic inflation. Finally, we also found cultural and systemic issues with the way consumers are encouraged to purchase food. With this in mind, we propose nationwide and state specific solutions to food waste.
